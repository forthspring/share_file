I’m Foster, from GDT wholesale data & analytics platform team. I have been working in HSBC for 4 years.  Before I joined HSBC. I had been working as an engineer of ZTE corporation  in India for 4 years.  The diversity of culture in india really suprised me. So I learnt the Indian language hindi. And I can talk in Hindi fluently with the Indians. ZTE corportation had a project about  the  big data product. I gained good knowledge about the big data from there. After I quit that job and returned to China, I believed that Hadoop & Spark technology would have a good future. I spent a lot of time to learn about it. In 2019, I entered HSBC as expert of Hadoop & Spark in GBM big data platform team. The team was very new, we started to build a platform from scratch. Nowadays, we got about 450 servers and more than 30 use cases running. In the meantime, our department got merged into Wholesale IT, and then got merged into GDT. Other than the big data, I have  expert skill in Linux system, Postgres Database, Airflow scheduler and CICD pipeline. I also have good knowledge about micro-services Elasticsearch and etc.  I have a bunch of certifications, regarding big data, cloud,  data science and deeplearning. I got married last year and I have a child who is 8 months old. In my spare time, I take care of my child, hang out with my family, and play pingpong from time to time.
